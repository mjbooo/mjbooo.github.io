Hi, I'm a M.S candidate in [KAIST Graduate School of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/).  
I am very fortunate to have Prof. [Edward Choi](https://mp2893.com/) as my advisor. 
My research interest lies at the intersection of Machine Learning, NLP, Multimodal learning, and Healthcare. 
I currently work on (1) synthesizing data with multimodality and (2) with diffusion model, and (3) exploring optimal encoder for EHR (electronic health record).
