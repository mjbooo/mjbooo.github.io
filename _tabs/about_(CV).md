Hi, I'm a M.S candidate in Graduate School of AI at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).  
I am very fortunate to have Prof. [Edward Choi](https://mp2893.com/) as my advisor.  
I currently conduct research projects on autoencoding/synthesizing/multi-modal learning w.r.t Electronic Health Record (EHR).
